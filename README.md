# Working with Fibonacci in Node.js

start
`docker-compose up -d`

I have tested my codesnippet and it satisfies with all requirements from this document.

Offloading a CPU-Bound Task(Calculating Fibonacci number) with the worker-threads Module, solved blocking operation and implemented multithreading.

Using Javascript Array it can calculate 30000th fibonacci number(with high speed performance), I will consider more efficient way and whole complete way.
